# TigerBeetle-CMake

`tigerbeetle-cmake` is an extension of TigerBeetle C++ project designed to make it more versatile and accessible for a wider range of languages. **TigerBeetleDB** is a financial accounting database created with a strong focus on mission-critical safety and high-performance capabilities, serving as the foundation for the future of financial services.

This project aims to provide a straightforward C++ solution derived from the original C binding, making it easier for developers to work with TigerBeetle in C++. However, it's important to note that this client is not limited to C++. You can easily modify the `CMakeLists.txt` file to use it with other languages supported by CMake, making it a powerful tool for a variety of development environments.

One of the unique aspects of `tigerbeetle-cmake` is its integration of **Zig** with **CMake**. It demonstrates how to build the `tb_client` library using Zig without requiring users to delve into the Zig toolchain or learn it in-depth. This feature simplifies the development process and ensures that **TigerBeetle** is accessible to a broader audience.
